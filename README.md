Hello!

This is AstroJoJo, a web app designed to fetch information from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, returning the title, image, video, and description with a given input date.

This exercise was done in to fullfil the requirements of the Code Louisville JavaScript Certificate Course.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
After cloning the repo, in your terminal you will want to "npm install", or "yarn install" to get the required dependencies. You must have NodeJS as this is a React App.
Make sure you are CDed into /AstroJoJo with your terminal of choice.
Use "npm start" or "yarn start" (depending on what manager you are using) to host the app on localhost:3000.
It should auto open up a window for you, but if it doesn't, navigate to "http://localhost:3000/"

ALTERNATIVELY:

https://astro-jo-jo.vercel.app/

I have the repo hosted up on vercel.com

This app features the following:

* It is written in React
* It makes use of the latest Bootstrap for responsive design styling for mobile, tablet, and desktop
* It consults an external API and displays data from that API (The NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day) and displays it
* It implements a regex expression for form validation in the date picker (which features a nice and easy to access calander)
* For "Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value",
this is done multiple times as many of the components (which are functions), accept props (which are parameters) which change the respective state (which is the value).
* Likewise, please appreciate this is a first delving into React and thus the main exercise was to make use of the framework consisting of:
* Creating, displaying, and styling custom components,
* Feeding those components props and
* Changing the state of the elements on the page depending on the functionality of those components.

I hope you enjoy my project! To infinity and beyond!
